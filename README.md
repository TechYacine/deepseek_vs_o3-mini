this a simple comparision between 2 chat-bots , I told them to Write a p5.js script that simulates 100 colorful balls bouncing inside a sphere. Each ball should leave behind a fading trail showing its recent path. The container sphere should rotate slowly. Make sure to implement proper collision detection so the balls stay within the sphere.
