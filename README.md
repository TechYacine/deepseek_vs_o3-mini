# deepseek_vs_o3-mini
Hello everyone 
This a simple comparision between 2 chat-bots , I told them to Write a p5.js script that simulates 100 colorful balls bouncing inside a sphere. Each ball should leave behind a fading trail showing its recent path. The container sphere should rotate slowly. Make sure to implement proper collision detection so the balls stay within the sphere.


I gonna show you a simple comparison between deepseek and the new version of chat-gpt (free for now) which called o3-mini
so the files are P5.js 
Important : u must have at least a graphic card to see better results because I've tried in my laptop and it was a bit buggy , I switch to a another pc with a graphic card and I had excellent results 

First u should go to vs code and install P5canvas extainsion , then open the file and u can see in the buttom left P5canvas appear , click on it and everything should work then .. 
thank u every one .....
